# AI-based-Fault-detection-system-for-Power-Electronics-Converters
Objective: Develop an AI-driven system to identify and analyze faults in power electronics converters, ensuring optimal performance and reducing downtime.
Overview

This project focuses on the development of an AI-based fault detection system for power electronics converters. Power converters play a critical role in various applications, such as electric vehicles, renewable energy systems, and industrial automation. However, they are prone to faults which can lead to reduced efficiency, failure of components, or even system breakdowns. This system leverages machine learning models to identify and classify faults in real-time, improving system reliability and reducing downtime.

Features
Real-time Fault Detection: Monitors the operation of power converters in real-time to detect anomalies or faults.
AI/ML Model Integration: Utilizes supervised learning models trained on phase current data and other electrical signals to classify different types of faults.
Data-driven Analysis: The system is capable of analyzing large amounts of simulation or operational data to detect subtle patterns that indicate a fault.
Scalability: Designed to work with different types of power electronics converters, including DC-DC, DC-AC, and AC-DC converters.

Data Collection and Preprocessing
The dataset used for training the fault detection model is generated from Simulink simulations. The system simulates various fault conditions, including open-circuit faults, short-circuit faults, and parameter degradation in the power electronics converter. The phase current and voltage waveforms are extracted and processed into feature sets for training.

Data processing includes:

Signal Filtering
Feature Extraction
Labeling the data with the corresponding fault type.
Machine Learning Model
The project uses supervised learning algorithms like Random Forest or Artificial Neural Networks to classify faults.

Future Enhancements
Support for Multiple Converter Types: Extending the system to work with additional types of converters, such as multi-level inverters.
Fault Diagnosis: Enhancing the system to not only detect faults but also diagnose the root cause and severity.
Real-Time Implementation: Implementing the system in real-time hardware platforms like FPGA or DSP.
